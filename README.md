## 🔧 Methodology

- **Data Source**: Speech text sourced from a public URL
- **Tools Used**:  
  - R programming language  
  - Packages: `tm`, `SnowballC`, `wordcloud`, `RColorBrewer`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Corpus Creation**: Loaded and converted raw text into a corpus
  2. **Preprocessing**:
     - Lowercased text
     - Removed stopwords, numbers, punctuation, and excess whitespace
     - Removed irrelevant/custom words
  3. **Term-Document Matrix (TDM)**:
     - Generated a matrix for quantitative text analysis
  4. **Visualization**:
     - Created a word cloud to highlight frequent terms
     - Generated a bar plot for top 10 words
  5. **Association Analysis**:
     - Used correlation to find associations (e.g., words related to "freedom")
